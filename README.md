This notebook can simply be run in your browser by clicking on the Binder button below:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ehatton/experimental_dna_binding_sites/main?filepath=experimental_dna_binding_sites.ipynb)

Alternatively you can download the file and run it on your local machine by installing python (and a few other dependencies), see the [Requirements](#requirements) section below for details.

## Requirements

- python version 3.6 or above (the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution is recommended)

- [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/install) (if you have the Anaconda python distribution then this is installed by default)

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (again, if you have the Anaconda python distribution then this is installed by default)
